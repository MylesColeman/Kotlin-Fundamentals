# Kotlin Fundamentals (WIP)
This repository documents my initial transition into **Kotlin**, starting with foundational exercises in the Kotlin Playground as part of the **Mobile and Multiplayer** module at **Teesside University**.

## Key Highlights
* **Core Syntax Mastery**: Exercises covering collections, loops, null safety, and extension functions.
* **Java to Kotlin Translation**: Ported a **Low Pass Filter** implementation from Java to Kotlin, ensuring mathematical accuracy while adopting Kotlin's idiomatic style.
* **OOP & Abstract Systems**: Implementations of abstract shape classes and interfaces to explore Kotlin's inheritance and property systems.

## Contents
* `Introduction.kt`: Overview of basic syntax, types, and control flow.
* `ShapeClasses.kt`: Exploration of abstract classes and polymorphism.
* `LowPassFilter.kt`: Optimized signal processing logic ported from Java.
* `CaseFlipping.kt` & `ListSplitter.kt`: Practical algorithmic exercises.

---
*This repository will eventually be merged into a comprehensive Mobile & Multiplayer foundations collection.*
